# Password-Generator
Password Generator for my week 3 Javascript Challenge

This website is a random number generator. From the Main page, you are able to add any character amount between 8-128.

Then there are several choices for HOW you want the password to be generated, each check box notates another character type to be added or subtracted from the way the password generator works.
Check each box that corresponds to your password type, then hit "Generate Password", and you'll have a fancy new secure and randomized password.

In looking through the console log, i have logged a few functionalities for my own use, to ensure the randomization of characters is always happening upon running the page, ensuring every password given is unique.
There are no errors, and you can continue to generate as many new passwords as youd like. 

Thank you for reading, and enjoy my Password Generator page!
